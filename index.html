<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congratulations!! Now you have your first IceBreak server up and running. Now it is time to make it work for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the key features is to use RPG (or any other ILE language) as a host language for running web application. The key concept is the server root path on the IFS and the application library where the program object is stored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we first take a look at the server root path, then you will see something similar to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<img width="381" height="274" src="/system/images/myfirst.png">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The server root content:</h2>

<h3>webConfig.xml</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The webConfig.xml contains a list of runtime properties for the web application. Where to upload files, routing, hives among other advanced features. The features are described within the webConfig.xml.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>index.html</h3>
<p>This is the file you are reading right now</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>.vsCode</h3>
<p>This is compiler support and development support for Microsoft vsCode environment. It is a free alternative to Microsoft Development studio. Please fell free to download it from here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When installed then search for RPG in vsCode extensions to get full edit and compile support for ILE rpg.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>system hive</h3>
<p>
A hive is a virtual folder, so you can not see it directly in the directory outline. 
You have by default access to the "system" hive when the server is in 
development mode. When switching into production you still have access to the 
static resources, but if need you can disable these in the webconfg.xml 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Next Step:</h2>
Follow the programmers guide and make the first program
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Simply paste this into you editor, and save it as "hello.rpgle" on server root path.   
<pre style="font-family:monospace;background-color:black;color:#89beed;margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px">
<%@ language="RPGLE"%>
<%
ctl-opt main(sayHello); 
dcl-proc sayHello;
	
    dcl-s  message      varchar(256);
    
    // Get the data from the URL
    message = qryStr('message');

    // Send the response back 
    %>Hello world. <%= message %>, time is <%= %char(%timestamp())%><%

end-proc;
</pre>
